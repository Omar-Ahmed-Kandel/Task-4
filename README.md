## 📝 Executive Summary
The analysis shows strong revenue performance (**14.4M**) with exceptional YoY growth (**344.45%**).  
Orders are well-handled with **99K total orders**, **96K delivered**, and an impressive **~99–100% on-time delivery rate**.  
While performance is strong overall, **freight costs (2M)** remain a key challenge in some product categories, potentially impacting margins.

---

## 🎯 Objectives & Key Questions
- Track overall revenue, orders, and growth.  
- Understand payment method contributions.  
- Measure order delivery performance and cancellations.  
- Identify categories with high freight cost % of price.  
- Pinpoint top-performing cities and product categories.  

---

## ⚙️ Data Preparation
- Data was extracted from the provided dataset into **Power BI**.  
- Cleaned and structured to show revenue by month, category, city, and payment type.  
- Built visuals for orders, delivery status, freight, and cancellations.  

---

## 📌 Key Measures & KPIs
- **Total Revenue:** 14.4M  
- **Total Payment:** 16.01M  
- **Total Freight:** 2M  
- **YoY Growth:** 344.45%  
- **Total Orders:** 99K  
- **Delivered Orders:** 96K  
- **Avg Delivery Days:** ~12 days  
- **On-Time Delivery Rate:** ~99–100%  

---

## 💡 Insights & Recommendations
- **Revenue** is diverse across payment methods (boleto, credit card, debit card, voucher).  
- **Top product categories:** beauty, watches, home goods, and sports.  
- **Major cities driving sales:** São Paulo, Curitiba, Rio de Janeiro.  
- **Delivery operations** are highly reliable, but average delivery time (12 days) could be shortened.  
- **Freight costs** are high in some categories (e.g., furniture, flowers, large items) → optimization needed.  
- **Cancellations**, while smaller in volume, still represent lost revenue and should be reduced.  

---

## ⚠️ Limitations
- Analysis is based only on the **Power BI visuals** provided in the PDF.  
- No **SKU-level or profitability breakdown** (Revenue − Freight − Fees).  
- **Cancellation reasons** not deeply explored in available data.  

---

## 🚀 Next Steps & Decisions
- **Freight Optimization:** Negotiate carrier rates and review packaging for high-freight categories.  
- **Delivery KPIs by Segment:** Break down by SKU, seller, and region to reduce lead time.  
- **Reduce Cancellations:** Improve stock sync, payment retries, and clearer delivery timelines.  
- **City-Level Playbooks:** Focus on top cities with targeted marketing and logistics strategies.  
- **Enhance Dashboard:** Add profitability and cancellation funnel for deeper insights.
